# Mini cluster test binaries
# -------------------------
#
# This script generates optimized, dynamically-linked, stripped, fully
# relocatable Kudu server binaries for easy use by integration tests using a
# mini cluster. The resulting binaries should never be deployed to run an
# actual Kudu service, whether in production or development, because all
# security dependencies are copied from the build system and will not be
# updated if the operating system on the runtime host is patched.
#
# Properties file
# ---------------
#
# The JAR that is generated contains a properties file in META-INF that allows
# it to be located by Java code at runtime if the JAR is on the classpath.
# The location of that file in the archive is:
#
# META-INF/apache-kudu-test-binary.properties
#
# The following properties are supported:
#
# * format.version: The format of the artifact, in case we need to extend it
#   later and be able to tell the difference between the archive formats.
# * artifact.version: The version of the release (or snapshot, i.e.
#   1.9.0-SNAPSHOT) in order for the format to support support multiple
#   versions on the classpath or to allow a client to be able to request a
#   specific release version.
# * artifact.prefix: The directory name at the root of the JAR under which the
#   binary files can be found (similar to ./configure --prefix in autoconf).
# * artifact.os: The operating system name using the same convention as
#   https://github.com/trustin/os-maven-plugin for ${os.detected.name}.
#   Practically speaking for Kudu at the time of writing, that is either
#   'linux' or 'osx'.
# * artifact.arch: The target system architecture using the same convention as
#   os-maven-plugin for ${os.detected.arch}. Practically speaking for Kudu, at
#   the time of writing this will always be set to x86_64.
#
# Example:
#
# $ cat META-INF/apache-kudu-test-binary.properties
# format.version=1
# artifact.version=1.8.0
# artifact.prefix=kudu-binary-1.8.0-linux-x86_64
# artifact.os=linux
# artifact.arch=x86_64

This archive contains Kudu binaries for use in a "mini cluster" environment for
TESTING ONLY.

The binaries in this archive should never be deployed to run an actual Kudu
service, whether in production or development, because many security-related
dependencies are copied from the build system and will not be patched when the
operating system on the runtime host is patched.
